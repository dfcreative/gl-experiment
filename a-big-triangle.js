/**
 * Setup: test how a-big-triangle provides full vertex coverage
 *
 * Result: it does not. It requires user to set vertex shader with `position` attribute.
 * Moreover, it requires user to show how position is mapped.
 * So basically it just connects a buffer with huge triangle in it, but thatâ€™s it.
 * If user defines some custom mapping, it can be not big triangle anymore.
 * Literally this module is just a big triangle, it is not a big triangle painter in any way.
 * That said, if you need custom uniforms, just provide them along in the vertex shader and calc them based on position input.
 * Note that varyings are interpolated relative to the output range.
 * Feels like gl_Position just sets clipping area of already rendered triangle, interpolation is always bound to the vertex coords.
